					<h3>Saber (2023-present) – Project Leader</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> (Semi)Interactive Web-based Python Programming Material</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> In this project (which is in its early stage), we aim at providing an integrated learning infrastructure to support Python 
					programming courses in the development of 
					their teaching material. We plan to publish this material as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) available for learners. 
					This project has external contributors at VU Amsterdam, University Twente, TU Delft, Wageningen University & Research, and University of Groningen.
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>NOLAI (2023-present)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> Artificial intelligence in Education</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> In this project, we aim to create a prototype that allows students to pose questions, refine them, and where feasible, find answers. 
					Additionally, the prototype enhances interactions between students and teachers when addressing questions, as the questions are improved, and students have already contemplated the 
					problem-solving process. As a result, the question is refined even before the teacher addresses it. Consequently, one group of students can expedite their exit from the queue, while the other 
					group receives more personalized and quicker assistance from the teacher. This immediate support facilitates deeper learning. Utilizing a chatbot, students are prompted with a series of 
					process-related questions, such as "What steps have you already taken?" and "Which steps did not lead to a solution?" This approach yields a sharply focused question for the teacher, 
					with a well-defined problem.
					</ul>

					<h3>Cubun (2022-present)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> Managing atomic exercises and their combination into gradable exercises sets</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> In this project, we aim at sharing the efforts invested in the maintenance and creation of Python programming exercises 
					and aligning the use of such exercises with specific learning objectives. That is, we plan to centralize the storage and maintenance of the exercises; so we can then (i) reuse the 
					exercises in the different Python programming courses offered by the M\&CS department, (ii) improve their quality, (iii) associate programming exercises with specific learning objectives, 
					and (iv) automate the generation of gradable exercises sets for different courses based on learning needs.
					<br>
					Python programming exercises are designed to work with <a href="https://momotor.org/" target="_blank"><u>Momotor</u></a>). Momotor is an automated feedback system 
					developed at TU/e and currently used by several courses at the University. It provides concrete feedback to students and automatically grades the students' submissions 
					based on a testframe file. It is usually used via a Canvas plugin, but it can also be integrated into other solutions such as web applications.

					<h3>LpLc (2021-2024)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> Web-based Learning Environment for Formative Testing of Logic Circuits</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> In this research project, we discuss the development, implementation, and testing of a web-based learning environment to 
					visualize information within logic circuit design. The learning environment will be designed to deliver information according to the Four-Component Instructional Design model 4C/ID. 
					Four different aspects of logic circuit design are presented: (i) code-based (Verilog hardware description language, (ii) graphical-based (gate level view), (iii) Boolean function, and (iv) truth table. 
					In addition, supportive information and interaction are considered, as they can support learners' understanding and performance. 
					We aim to motivate students to practice independently by providing gamified learning activities using an interactive web-based tool. 
					The tool is aimed to be a supplementary tool next to face-to-face classes.

					<h3>QPED (2021-2023)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> Improvement of programming courses by developing curriculum independent materials</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> The Erasmus project Quality-focused Programming EDucation (QPED) involves universities and companies 
					in Spain (Open University Catalunya), Germany (Marburg University and Quarterfall), and The Netherlands (Open University Heerlen and TU/e). 
					QPED aims at the universities to develop curriculum independent materials, notably Procedural Guidance and Testing, that can be used by the consortium members 
					and other institutions in their curriculum.
					</ul>

					<h3>SMILE (2017-2020)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> Unique assisted learning system to control smart objects and living labs via visual block-based programming environments</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> The idea of this project was to design, develop, implement and evaluate a visual 
					block-based programming environment that could be used in introductory programming courses and workshops. The programming environment 
					enabled inexperienced students and novice programmers to program smart environments, micro-controllers, and mobile robots one at a time and in 
					combination with each other. To this end, we took advantage of the Google Blockly library to develop the programming environment.
					<br>	
					In this project, the starting point was to produce a unique visual block-based programming environment, including a frontend, middleware, and backend, 
					which can work based on Open Home Automation Bus (OpenHAB), Arduino Code, and Robot Operating System (ROS). This programming environment 
					(which is called <a href="https://github.com/projekt-smile/BEESM" target="_blank"><u>BEESM</u></a>) allowed application developers and educators to synchronize their desire backend system 
					with the environment’s frontend having minimal changes in the middleware. Furthermore, the programming environment was employed in several introductory 
					programming courses and workshops. This environment was evaluated using inexperienced students and novice programmers in order to find out how their 
					programming skills and attitudes towards programming are influenced over time.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>SELFIE (2016-2017)</h3>
					<p>
					<ul class="move">
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Area of Working:</b> Visualization of Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Lab (BAALL)</li>
					<br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Project Description:</b> The idea of this project was to virtualize the Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Lab (BAALL). To this end, we took advantage 
						of photogrammetric methods. Thus, the starting point was to take a set of appropriate photographs from the BAALL and then reconstruct the geometry and texture of the BAALL's interior. 
						In the next step, reconstruction errors like holes, peek, etc. were eliminated. Finally, dynamic objects (e.g., doors) were segmented from the static geometry mesh, and so the 3D-model 
						could be dynamic and interactive.</li>
